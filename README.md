Finished all steps for Project: Recipes. Took about 2 hours. Solidified my knowledge on the <html> base code that is used for all of them, being able to write it from memory now. 

What i have learned: 

<figure> and <figcaption> as a menas to had a caption to an image. <img src> is used inside <figure>, as well as <figcaption>.
Saving my files and giving them their file type myself through my keyboard. Was having problems with all the images for the recipes being webp, until i noticed i could just write it myself. 
Understood how to push my project into github a little better.

What i must learn more about:

Github commands and all it's -f, -m, etc. Attributes? Is that their name? -->
