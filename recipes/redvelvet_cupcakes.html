          <li>1 ounce bottle red food color</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
          <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 (16 ounce) box confectioner's sugar</li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners. </li>
        <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
        <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla. </li>
        <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely. </li>
        <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth. </li>
        <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
      </ol>
